# Week 3 – Process Scheduling

## 📝 Reflection
This week I studied how operating systems schedule processes.  
I learned about different scheduling algorithms:
- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** – runs processes in the order they arrive.
- **Shortest Job Next (SJN)** – runs the shortest process first.
- **Round Robin (RR)** – gives each process a fixed time slice.
- **Priority Scheduling** – runs higher-priority processes first.

I practiced using Linux commands like `ps`, `top`, and `nice` to observe and adjust process priorities.

## ✅ Conclusion
I understood how scheduling affects system performance and fairness.  
Round Robin ensures responsiveness, while Priority Scheduling can cause starvation if not managed.
